## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### First Tool (Cutadapt)

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
    
The type of research that this tool Cutadapt is developed to facilitate is the field of Bioinformatics.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

The way in which Cutadapt works is that it's able to clean up the data in your DNA sequence data file. This means that you can format your data in a way that is more readable for a program or a person. When you run this tool it first processes the data and begins to detect the multiple `adapter types`. The adapter types that it works with is `5'` and `3'`. You can also determine when the program has to trim out sections of the data and set your error tolerance.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
    
I think that this tool Cutadapt was necessary to develop because it's very important to be able to make accurate and clean edits to a file containing DNA information. Since with this tool you cam make your data more accurate, this would therefore return more accurate results for when you use this information in an experiment. 

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool? 

A potential misuse of this tool could include 


### Second Tool (FastQC)

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

This tool FastQC is used for the field of Bioinformatics.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 
This tool allows you to perform quality checks on a raw genetic sequence. It was developed using the Java programming language. There are several checks that this program does when it's determining the quality of the inputted high pace raw genetic sequence. First, it returns a basic list of statistics about the input file name, file type, total sequences, sequence length, and the percentage of GC. Some other checks that this program does includes per base N content and per sequence quality scores.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

I think that this tool FastQC was very important to develop because it checks the quality of a DNA sequence input. By not checking for the quality of the data before any analysis is completed, we cannot be confident in the results of any subsequent experiment. I think that this tool also allows you to measure the size of the error coming from the data you're using. If you come to an unusual conclusion after your research you could use the size of the error to discuss or determine the extent to which this impacted the results of your research.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

The only undesirable consequence that could come from the use of FastQC is checking the quality of a DNA sequence file for bad means. That would be malicious actors developing biological weapons, and using this tool to check the quality of the sequence of their developed biological pathogen.
